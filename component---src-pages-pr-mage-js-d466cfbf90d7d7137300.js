We present MAGE, a scalable, multicore subgraph matching approach that supports expressive queries over large, richly-attributed graphs. Our major contributions include: (1) MAGE supports graphs with both node and edge attributes (most existing approaches handle either one, but not both); (2) it supports expressive queries, allowing multiple attributes on an edge, wildcards as attribute values (i.e., match any permissible values), and attributes with continuous values; and (3) it is scalable, supporting graphs with several hundred million edges. We demonstrate MAGEâ€™s effectiveness and scalability via extensive experiments on large real and synthetic graphs, such as a Google+ social network with 460 million edges.",paper_linky:"../data/14-bigdata-mage.pdf",paper_img:"../imgs/projs/pr-mage-cj.png",img_caption:"An illustrative example of how MAGE finds patterns in an intelligence graph (left) with node and edge attributes. Node attributes: Person, Event, or Location. Edge attributes (amount of gathered intelligence for a pair of entities): Confirmed, Suspected, or Unlikely. A query (middle) looks for two indirectly related individuals, who were both confirmed at an event location and are believed to have attended the event (two lines connecting the corresponding nodes). The node with a star indicates a wildcard, which can take any attribute value. (All figures best viewed in color.)
